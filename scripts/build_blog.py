     "<p><b>2. Book while you sleep.</b> A simple after-hours answering service or online scheduler that locks in the appointment beats a voicemail nobody checks. The contractor who books it tonight does the job tomorrow.</p>"
     "<p><b>3. Make your site easy to reach you from.</b> A giant tap-to-call button and a text option mean the lead reaches you the way they prefer — see <a href=\"https://booked-job.com/blog/contractor-website-one-job/\">why 98% leave your website</a>.</p>"),
