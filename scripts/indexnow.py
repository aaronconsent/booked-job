"""IndexNow pings — tell IndexNow-participating engines about new/updated URLs the
moment they publish, instead of waiting days for a crawl. The key is PUBLIC by
protocol design (served at the site root as proof of ownership), so it lives here.

By protocol, submitting to ANY one participating endpoint shares the URLs with the
whole IndexNow network. We POST to several and count success if ANY accepts, so one
engine rejecting doesn't fail the ping. CONFIRMED 2026-07-21: Yandex accepts (202)
and the URLs then show up in Bing Webmaster Tools -> IndexNow as Source: Self — i.e.
they DO reach Bing via the shared network. Bing's own direct endpoint still returns
403 UserForbiddedToAccessSite for direct POSTs of this key (its direct-submit key
check is stricter than its network ingestion), but that's cosmetic: the pings land.
booked-job.com (apex) is verified in Bing Webmaster Tools.

  python3 scripts/indexnow.py --all          # submit every URL in the sitemap
